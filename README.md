![.](/teaser.png)
In this study, we propose a computational framework for optimizing the continuity of the toolpath in fabricating surface models on an extrusionbased 3D printer. We introduce a criterion called the “one-path patch” (OPP) to represent a patch on the surface of the shell that can be traversed along one path by considering the constraints on fabrication. We study the properties of the OPPs and their merging operations to propose a bottom-up OPP merging procedure to decompose the given shell surface into a minimal number of OPPs, and to generate the "as-continuous-aspossible" (ACAP) toolpath.
